## 🔹 Experiment 1: Right-Aligned Star Triangle

### ✅ Aim
To print a right-aligned triangle using stars (`*`) across multiple rows.

### 📚 Theory
In this pattern, each line contains a number of spaces followed by an increasing number of stars. The pattern creates a triangle aligned to the right by reducing the spaces and increasing the stars row by row.

### 📝 Conclusion
This experiment demonstrates how nested loops can be used in C++ to control both spacing and symbols in a structured manner. It reinforces the understanding of loop-based formatting.

## 🔹 Experiment 2: Left-Aligned (Flipped) Star Triangle

### ✅ Aim
To create a simple left-aligned triangle using stars (`*`).

### 📚 Theory
Each row starts from one star and increases by one in each subsequent row. No spacing is required, making it a basic example of triangle formation using nested loops.

### 📝 Conclusion
This is a foundational pattern that helps solidify the understanding of basic nested loops. It is often the first step toward learning more complex patterns.

## 🔹 Experiment 3: Floyd's Triangle (Incremental Number Pattern)

### ✅ Aim
To print natural numbers in a triangular pattern similar to Floyd’s Triangle.

### 📚 Theory
Floyd’s Triangle displays consecutive numbers in a right-angled triangle format. Each row has one more number than the previous. It combines loop logic with value tracking using a counter.

### 📝 Conclusion
This experiment illustrates how nested loops and a running counter can be combined to generate structured numerical patterns. It helps in learning variable control within loops.

## 🔹 Experiment 4: Hourglass (Symmetric Pattern Using Array)

### ✅ Aim
To print a symmetric, hourglass-shaped pattern using stars (`*`) with the help of an array.

### 📚 Theory
A predefined array is used to specify the number of stars for each row. Spacing is calculated to center the stars, resulting in a visually balanced hourglass pattern. This involves both horizontal symmetry and precise space management.

### 📝 Conclusion
This experiment showcases how arrays and spacing logic can be used to produce symmetric designs. It strengthens logic building for advanced pattern problems and real-world formatting challenges.

## 📦 Final Remarks

These pattern-printing programs build the core logic skills required for beginner-level programming. They strengthen the understanding of nested loops, conditional spacing, and pattern construction — all of which are essential in C++ and competitive coding.
